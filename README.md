# 100 Days of DSA

Welcome to the **100 Days of DSA** repository! This project is a journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a 100-day challenge. Each day, a new problem or concept is tackled to build a strong foundation in DSA.

## Introduction

The **100 Days of DSA** challenge is designed to provide a structured approach to learning DSA. The goal is to cover various topics including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming through daily exercises and problem-solving.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **`/day1`**: Problems and solutions for Day 1.
- **`/day2`**: Problems and solutions for Day 2.
- ...
- **`/day100`**: Problems and solutions for Day 100.

Each day's folder contains:
- A problem statement or description.
- Solution code.
- Explanations and notes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **100 Days of DSA** challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100th_days_of_DSA.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Specific Day's Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd 100th_days_of_DSA/day_1
   ```

3. **Review the Problem Statement:**
   Open the `problem_description.md` file to understand the problem for the day.

4. **Check the Solution:**
   Review the solution in the `solution.py` (or `.cpp`, `.java`, etc.) file.

5. **Practice and Experiment:**
   Implement the solution yourself and experiment with variations to deepen your understanding.
